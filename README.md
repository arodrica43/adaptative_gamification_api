# Adaptative Gamification Api
An api for embed adaptative gamification mechanics (as well as common mechanics) in your web project.

## Features ##

Currently the api generates incrustable code for the following gamification mechanics:

- asds
- asdasd

## Installation ##

The api doesn't need any special installation: Just ensure that your virtualenv have installed all requirements (requirements.txt) or use the default venv in this repo (probably not working by dependences with the current development machine).

## Usage ##

Use django's runserver to run the application.
